# AiThena

A simple demo landing page for **AiThena**, my personal learning project — an AI-powered interactive learning companion that will eventually include:
- Micro lessons  
- Hints powered by AI  
- XP and level system  
- A clean, simple user interface  

🌐 **Live Demo:**

This project is just starting, and I'm learning step-by-step how to build and deploy it using:
- HTML  
- Git  
- GitHub  
- VS Code  
- GitHub Pages  

More updates coming soon!
